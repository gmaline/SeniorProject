## Identification and Characterization of Butyrate Producing Species in the Human Gut Microbiome

## Introduction
In this project we explore genomes from HMP 1 (*source link here*) to attempt to identify species that may be capable of butyrate production based on the presence of enzyme-encoding genes involved in the pathway(s) of butyrate production. In this repository, you will find the code and methods used for data formatting, protein alignments, and data analysis.
